This is the GitHub repository used for my final project in STAT 892.  

•	The main paper was written in the file `paper.qmd`.  
    - The pdf version of this file was turned into canvas, though it used a different name.   
    - All R code and AI help can be found in the appendices of the paper.
    
•	All sources for the project can be found in the file `references.bib`.

•	`Plots-for-Experiment.pdf` contains all the plots that could be used for the survey associated with this experiment.  
    - All R code used can be found in the appendix and the document was made with `Plots for Experiment.pdf`
    
•	Photos used in the main paper are saved an `.png` files throughout the repository.

•	The dataset `2020 US Covid Deaths.csv` was used in the paper.

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.  Otherwise enjoy the break!
